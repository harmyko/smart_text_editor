# Object-Oriented Programming ‚Äì 2nd Semester Work (Vilnius University)

This repository contains my coursework for the 2nd semester module **Object-Oriented Programming** at **Vilnius University**, graded by **Linas Litvinas**.

It includes two main folders:
- `lab_1`: My first lab work.
- `smart-editor`: My semester-long project, developed in 7 stages from **Lab #2 to Lab #8**.

## üìÅ Project Structure

### `lab_1/`
Introduces Java basics: writing, compiling, and running a program, working with core syntax and standard classes like String. The task was to read a file with book entries and display titles written by a given author using FileReader and BufferedReader.

---

### `smart-editor/`
A modular text editor built step-by-step over the course of the semester. Each lab added new functionality, gradually evolving the project from a simple editor to a smart tool with advanced features.

#### **Lab #2** ‚Äì *Created an initial Java class modeling part of the smart editor, including constructors (with this()), fields with get/set access, overloaded methods, and static/final elements. A separate test class was used to create objects and demonstrate their behavior via method calls and output.*

#### **Lab #3** ‚Äì *Built a class hierarchy with inheritance and polymorphism by creating at least three related classes across multiple packages. Used super() calls, method overriding (including toString()), and ensured polymorphic behavior through base-type references calling overridden methods.*

#### **Lab #4** ‚Äì *Implemented an interface-based design by creating or extending interfaces and connecting them to an abstract class, which was then implemented by a concrete class. The functionality was used through the most abstract type possible to emphasize abstraction and flexibility.*

#### **Lab #5** ‚Äì *Introduced custom exceptions by creating a base class extending Exception and a subclass with detailed error information. Exceptions were thrown, declared with throws, and caught in the main class to provide informative diagnostics to the user.*

#### **Lab #6** ‚Äì *Implemented the Factory Method design pattern, deep copy methods for Editor classes and used both features in a meaningful way inside the test class.*

#### **Lab #7** ‚Äì *Implemented the Serializable interface in the Editor and designed a basic Graphical User Interface and made use of threads to handle different processes.*

#### **Lab #8** ‚Äì *work in progress...*
The course emphasizes object-oriented design, abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. The final project demonstrates a practical application of these principles through iterative development.
